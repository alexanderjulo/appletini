To make this setup work you need to create a config.cfg in the project's root with the following settings:
SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=<uri to your database>

Of course you can include any other config options in it, like debugging and so on..

There are two custom config options I added, you should make use of:
WWW_TITLE
WWW_SLOGAN

use these to set your website's title and slogan.

the contact app has the following setting available:
WWW_CONTACT_MAIL

set this to the address you want your contact requests send to.

All settings are mandatory.
